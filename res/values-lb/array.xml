    The city names are presented to the user in an alphabetically-sorted list with section headers.
    The section header is the "index" of all the cities in the section. By default, the section
    header is the first character of the city name.

    Format of providing a city name:
    <item>[index]<xliff:g id="separator">=</xliff:g>[city name]<xliff:g id="phonetic">:</xliff:g>[phonetic name]</item>

    Index and phonetic name are optional.

    In some languages, cities are listed under an incorrect index or sorted incorrectly within an
    index.

    Should a city be listed under an incorrect index, the correct index can be manually specified
    by adding an index to the translation string before the "=" placeholder.

        Ex. <item>A<xliff:g id="separator">=</xliff:g>Abidjan</item>
        Now Abidjan will be classified under the "A" index.

    Note that the separator "=" should NOT be localized. The index can be multi-character; it will
    consist of all specified characters before the "=" separator.

    If a city is sorted incorrectly, provide a phonetic name for the city by adding
    <xliff:g id="phonetic">:</xliff:g>[PHONETIC_NAME]. The city now will be sorted based on phonetic
    name. The phonetic should use the alphabet that makes the most sense for the locale. For
    example, Japanese city can use Katakana to provide phonetic name.

    Providing index and/or phonetic name will change the sort order of the cities list.
